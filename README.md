The string library in python made working with strings very easy but this isn't availiable in c++. So I made it!

How to use:

Include this file in the same folder as with the one you are working on. 

Then in your working file write at top: #include "String.cpp"

Now you can start using this String Datatype and all of its functions.

It has functions like add, append, remove, slice, index etc.
